    <h3> Im Unique because...</h3>
    <p> I am a funny individual who tries to make everyone around me feel comfortable and inspired</p>
    <p> I had to grow up in an age where I got to see both sides of technology. I saw the Pager come and go, and cell phones take over. I have had dialup internet and I have had 1 gig fiber internet. Those are only a couple of examples that giive me a unique perspective when it comes to advancements in technology.</p>  <p> </p>
